/**
 * Creates non-overlapping segments based on overlapping annotations.
 *
 * Prosemirror combines overlapping inline decorations by creating segments in
 * which the props of each overlapping decoration are merged.
 *
 * The Prosemirror approach doesn't allow to calculate styles based on multiple
 * annotations, e.g. a darker background shade if there are multiple
 * annotations.
 *
 * To overcome this limitations, this method calculates non-overlapping segments
 * with overlapping annotations. These segments can be used to create
 * ProseMirror decorations with a style that reflects all all annotations within
 * the segment.
 *
 * Approach was confirmed by Marijn:
 * https://discuss.prosemirror.net/t/how-to-style-overlapping-inline-decorations/3162
